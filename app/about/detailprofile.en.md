## Why I Want to Become an ERP Consultant

My aspiration to become an ERP consultant traces back to my elementary school days. Even then, I vaguely dreamed of "creating enterprise core systems in the future." As a child, I was already interested in the mechanisms that support business activities.

When I seriously started thinking about my career path in high school, I recalled this childhood dream. Learning that ERP system implementation and operation could contribute to company-wide operational efficiency and business improvement, I became strongly attracted to the profession of ERP consultant. My decision to switch to the science track was because I believed I needed IT expertise to achieve this goal.

Currently, I am building the foundational skills necessary for an ERP consultant through obtaining the Fundamental Information Technology Engineer certification and studying Bookkeeping Level 3, developing both IT skills and business knowledge.

## Why I Want to Become a PM

My aspiration to become a project manager was sparked by my experience in my second year of university.

In my second year, I launched an app development project by gathering 8 members and 1 mentor on my own. Through this project, I experienced both the challenges and rewards of bringing a team together and guiding them toward a goal. I learned firsthand the importance of not just technical problem-solving, but also motivation management, scheduling, and communication.

From this experience, I became strongly attracted to the role of project manager—someone who oversees the entire project and leads the team to success, rather than just developing systems.
